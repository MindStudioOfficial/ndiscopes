## [v0.5.1-beta] 2022-07-08

### Fixed
- Fix scope layout initializing to all luminance scopes when updating from `v0.4.1`

If you have started the version `v0.5.0` you have to change the layout back manually in the `config.json` located at:
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\com.mindstudio\ndiscopes`

Here change the value of `scopeLayout` from `[0,0,0]` to `[0,1,2]`.

## [v0.5.0-beta] 2022-07-08

### Changed
- Changed Image rendering from using the slow CustomPaint to the much faster Texture workflow:

This Improves Performance by up to 400% (4 times the amount of frames processed per second)

| Resolution  | CustomPaint | Texture   | Average<br>Improvement |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1280 x 720  | 8 - 20 ms<br>50 - 125 fps | 3 - 6ms<br>170 - 330 fps  | 300%        |
| 1920 x 1080 | 15 - 50ms<br>20 - 70 fps   | 7 - 10ms<br>100 - 140 fps  | 350%        |
| 2560 x 1440 | 40 - 70ms<br>15 - 25 fps   | 12 - 20ms<br>50 - 85 fps | 340%        |
| 3840 x 2160 | 80 - >200ms<br>5 - 12 fps | 20 - 50ms<br>20 - 50 fps | 400%        |

Thanks to @alexmercerind and the people from the FlutterDev Discord for helping with the implementation.

For more detail and how these numbers were aquired look at this pullrequest #6.

- Other performance improvements in the user interface
- More responsive Sourceselector
- Option to stop receiving frames in Sourceselector
- Vectorscope is now colorized
- Audiometers are now colorful 
- Added performance statistics: 
  - image resolution
  - framerates (actual vs. metadata)
  - renderdelay

### Fixed
- Luminance Scope: Values from 16 to 235 are now mapped to the whole range of 0 - 255
- Audiometers were not visible if no audio data is received
- Vectorscope: Colored Squares were at the wrong saturation levels. (Now 100% and 75%)

### Other
- Added debugging messages for developers
- Disconnecting NDI connection before closing the app
- Added shutdown status text
- Adjusted window button colors
